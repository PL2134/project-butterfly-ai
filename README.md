# ü¶ã Project Butterfly AI

Project Butterfly AI is a personal growth assistant designed to help individuals transition toward their dream goals ‚Äî starting with my own journey from Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to AI Engineer in 5 months.

Every day, the bot sends a motivational question via Telegram to encourage reflection, focus, and deliberate action, building momentum one day at a time.

## üîÅ Iterations and Thought Process

This project was intentionally built through **progressive iterations**, simulating real-world AI engineering workflows:

1. **Phase 0 - Idea and MVP**
   - Start with a minimal Telegram bot using pure Python
   - Manually send a daily question using a hardcoded string

2. **Phase 1 - CI/CD Automation**
   - Migrate to GitHub Actions with scheduled cron jobs
   - Automatically run the bot daily without human intervention

3. **Phase 2 - Data Decoupling**
   - Move daily questions into a separate `questions.txt` file
   - Prepare the system for scalability and easier updates

4. **Phase 3 - Smart Progression**
   - Switch from random questions to **rotating structured questions**
   - Build a daily learning and habit stack aligned with career growth

5. **Phase 4 - Containerized & Versioned CI/CD**
   - Auto-publish production builds to GHCR as `vX.Y.Z`
   - Auto-publish dev/test builds as `test-vX.Y.Z.N` for traceability
   - Enable manual and push-based triggers for full control

6. **Planned Phase 5 and Beyond**
   - Record user answers and analyze growth patterns
   - Introduce lightweight database storage (PostgreSQL or Supabase)
   - Add NLP features for dynamic, personalized coaching
   - Deploy a backend API (FastAPI) for future expansion

## üöÄ How To Run It Yourself

1. Create your own Telegram Bot through [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Set two GitHub Secrets in your repository:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
3. Push your Python script and GitHub Action workflow
4. Enable GitHub Packages permissions for GHCR pushes
5. Watch as your daily coaching begins ‚Äî automatically!
